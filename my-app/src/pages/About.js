      <div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
        <p style={{ display: "inline-block", textAlign: "left" }}>
          I HAVE, alas! Philosophy,
          <br />
          Medicine, Jurisprudence too, <br />
          And to my cost Theology,
          <br />
          With ardent labour, studied through.
          <br />
          And here I stand, with all my lore,
          <br />
          Poor fool, no wiser than before.
          <br />
          Magister, doctor styled, indeed,
          <br />
          Already these ten years I lead,
          <br />
          Up, down, across, and to and fro,
          <br />
          My pupils by the nose,--and learn,
          <br />
          That we in truth can nothing know!
          <br />
          That in my heart like fire doth burn.
          <br />
          'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe,
          <br />
          Magister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;
          <br />
          Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,
          <br />
          Neither can devil nor hell now appal me-- <br />
          Hence also my heart must all pleasure forego!
          <br />
          I may not pretend, aught rightly to know,
          <br />
          I may not pretend, through teaching, to find
          <br />
          A means to improve or convert mankind.
          <br />
          Then I have neither goods nor treasure,
          <br />
          No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;
          <br />
          No dog in such fashion would longer live!
          <br />
          Therefore myself to magic I give,
          <br />
          In hope, through spirit-voice and might,
          <br />
          Secrets now veiled to bring to light,
          <br />
          That I no more, with aching brow,
          <br />
          Need speak of what I nothing know;
          <br />
          That I the force may recognise
          <br />
          That binds creation's inmost energies;
          <br />
          Her vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,
          <br />
          And fling the trade in empty words away.
          <br />
          O full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays
          <br />
          Their last upon mine anguish gaze!
          <br />
          Beside this desk, at dead of night,
          <br />
          Oft have I watched to hail thy light:
          <br />
          Then, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll,
          <br />
          With soothing power, thy radiance stole!
          <br />
          In thy dear light, ah, might I climb,
          <br />
          Freely, some mountain height sublime,
          <br />
          Round mountain caves with spirits ride,
          <br />
          In thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,
          <br />
          And, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew
          <br />
          My spirit, in thy healing dew!
          <br />
          Woe's me! still prison'd in the gloom
          <br />
          Of this abhorr'd and musty room!
          <br />
          Where heaven's dear light itself doth pass,
          <br />
          But dimly through the painted glass!
          <br />
          Hemmed in by book-heaps, piled around,
          <br />
          Worm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould,
          <br />
          Which to the high vault's topmost bound,
          <br />
          A smoke-stained paper doth enfold;
          <br />
          With boxes round thee piled, and glass,
          <br />
          And many a useless instrument,
          <br />
          With old ancestral lumber blent-- <br />
          This is thy world! a world! alas!
          <br />
          And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,
          <br />
          With tighten'd pressure in thy breast?
          <br />
          Why the dull ache will not depart,
          <br />
          By which thy life-pulse is oppress'd?
          <br />
          Instead of nature's living sphere,
          <br />
          Created for mankind of old,
          <br />
          Brute skeletons surround thee here,
          <br />
          And dead men's bones in smoke and mould.
